Groovy-Maven-Spock
======================

Currently a simple example which prints out the order in
which the various hooks for spring and spock are executed.

Also contains the dependencies for spring, spring security,
h2, and hibernate.

Contains a sample entity and test for creating an h2 schema
saving an entity and verifying it exists.

Meant to be an example to quick start pairing sessions, demos,
and as a base for quick testing projects.
